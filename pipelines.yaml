# Skill Conductor — Pipeline Configuration
#
# Define your development lifecycle here: phases, skills, and pipelines.
# The conductor skill reads this file at the start of every conversation.
#
# See examples/ for a full configuration using superpowers + shaping + review-loop.

# Phases: ordered slots in a development lifecycle.
# Define as many or few as your workflow needs.

# Skills: map skill names to phases.
#
# Types:
#   phase    — runs as a step in the pipeline sequence
#   modifier — triggers conditionally (e.g., after specific file changes)
#
# Source values are for documentation only — the conductor invokes
# skills by name via the Skill tool regardless of source.
skills:
  # Shape Up methodology: iterate on requirements and solution shapes
  shaping:
    source: vendor/shaping-skills
    phase: shape
    type: phase

  # Map system into UI/code affordances and wiring
  breadboarding:
    source: vendor/shaping-skills
    phase: shape
    type: phase

# Always-available skills: can be invoked at any point regardless of phase.
# Add skill names here that should never be gated by pipeline progression.
always-available: []

# Pipelines: named workflows that select which phases and skills to use.
#
# The conductor classifies tasks and suggests a pipeline. Users can override.
# Add your own pipelines to match your team's workflow.
pipelines:
  # Default workflow using the vendored shaping skills
